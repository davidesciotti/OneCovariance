ALARM: The resulting covariance matrix has negative eigenvalues
Try to adjust the accuracy settings in the config file:
For configuration space covariance reduce theta_accuracy and increase integration_intervals, usually a factor of 2 is enough.
For bandpower covariance reduce bandpower_accuracy.
For COSEBI covariance reduce En_accuracy.
