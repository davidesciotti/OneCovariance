Installation
============

The most recent stable version of ``OneCovariance`` should be installed directly from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:rreischke/OneCovariance.git
    cd OneCovariance
    conda env create -f conda_env.yaml
    conda activate cov20_env
    pip install .

On some Linux servers you will have to install ``gxx_linux-64`` by hand and the installation will not work. This usually shows the following error message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    gcc: fatal error: cannot execute 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory

If this is the case just install it by typing

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64

and redo ``pip install .``  .

If you do not want to use the conda environment, make sure that you have ``gfortran`` and ``gsl`` installed.
You can install both via ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge gfortran
    conda install -c conda-forge gsl
    conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64
    git clone git@github.com:rreischke/OneCovariance.git
    cd OneCovariance    
    pip install .

Once you have carried out these steps, you are ready to run the code. 
Lastly, since the code uses simpson instead of trapezoidal rules for some integrations, ``scipy`` should be at least version 1.11.
